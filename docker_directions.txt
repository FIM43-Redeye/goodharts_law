## The Setup
We have configured `compose.yaml` to support three different environments (profiles):
1.  **ROCm**: For AMD GPUs (`docker compose --profile rocm ...`)
2.  **CUDA**: For NVIDIA GPUs (`docker compose --profile cuda ...`) (UNTESTED!)
3.  **CPU**: For systems without a compatible GPU (`docker compose --profile cpu ...`)

## How to Work

### 1. Start the Environment
Open a terminal in the project folder and run ONE of the following commands depending on your hardware:

**For AMD (ROCm):**
```bash
docker compose --profile rocm up -d --build
```

**For NVIDIA (CUDA):**
```bash
docker compose --profile cuda up -d --build
```

**For CPU Only:**
```bash
docker compose --profile cpu up -d --build
```

This builds the image (if needed) and starts a container named `goodharts_law-dev-<profile>-1` in the background.

### 2. Enter the Environment (The "Terminal" Workflow)
To run your scripts, you need to be *inside* that container. Run the command matching your profile:

**ROCm:**
```bash
docker compose exec -it dev-rocm bash
```

**CUDA:**
```bash
docker compose exec -it dev-cuda bash
```

**CPU:**
```bash
docker compose exec -it dev-cpu bash
```

You will now be at a prompt like `appuser@<container-id>:/app$`.

### 3. Edit Code
You continue to edit code in **Antigravity** (your editor) just like normal. Since we mapped the volume (`.:/app`), any change you make in the editor is immediately visible inside the container.

### 4. Stop the Environment
When you are done, run:

```bash
docker compose down
```

## Troubleshooting
- **GPU Not Found or Permission Errors**:
    - **ROCm**: Ensure you have `/dev/kfd` and `/dev/dri` on your host machine.
    - If you see `CUDA available: False` or permission denied errors, it may be a Group ID mismatch.
    - Check the group ID of your render device: `stat -c '%g' /dev/kfd` (e.g., 109).
    - Run with that GID: `RENDER_GID=109 docker compose --profile rocm up -d --build`
    - **CUDA**: Ensure you have the NVIDIA Container Toolkit installed and updated drivers.
